sorting operation.

Exit(1) when the program completes without doing anything.
eg. If no inputs are given, or inputs are already sorted.

Exit(2) when the program exits due to input anomalies
like not-int (>max_int), and duplicate values.

Exit (3) when the program exits due to other errors like 
failure in memory allocations, etc.
